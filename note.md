Plan (MVP push-to-talk)

Expo records voice (press & hold or tap).

Upload audio file (m4a) to NestJS via FormData.

NestJS → transcribe (Whisper / gpt-4o-mini-transcribe).

NestJS → send transcript to OpenAI (system prompt = “English teacher”).

(Optional) NestJS → TTS to MP3 (voice reply).

Expo shows teacher text + plays audio reply.
